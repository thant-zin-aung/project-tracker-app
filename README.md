# 📅 Project Tracker App

A powerful and intuitive **project-based task management app** built with **React** — designed for organizing, assigning, and tracking tasks within collaborative teams. Unlike a basic to-do list, this application emphasizes structured project workflows, allowing users to break down complex goals into actionable tasks such as “UI design,” “backend logic,” and more.

Each **task card supports multiple contributors**, showcasing team members working together on the same task. The app provides a **clean and responsive UI** tailored for managing real-world projects with better visibility and accountability.
